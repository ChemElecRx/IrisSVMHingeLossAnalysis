# SVM Analysis of Iris Dataset

This project performs Support Vector Machine (SVM) analysis on the Iris dataset using Python and scikit-learn. It includes code to train an SVM classifier, evaluate its performance metrics, and visualize the results.

## Files

- `IrisSVMHingeLossVisualizer.py`: Python script containing the SVM analysis code.
- `figure_1.png`: Image file showing the SVM decision boundary visualization.
- `sample.py`: This script provides a small dataset consisting of 30 data pairs labeled as 0 and 1. The goal is to use this data to train a machine learning model to predict the labels of new data based on its features.

## Overview

The `IrisSVMHingeLossVisualizer.py` script loads the Iris dataset, preprocesses the data, splits it into training and testing sets, trains a LinearSVC classifier, evaluates its performance metrics including accuracy and hinge loss, and visualizes the decision boundary.

## Usage

Ensure you have Python and the necessary libraries installed. You can run the `IrisSVMHingeLossVisualizer.py` script to perform the analysis.

```bash
python IrisSVMHingeLossVisualizer.py
# IrisSVMHingeLossAnalysis
